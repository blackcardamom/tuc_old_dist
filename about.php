    <h2 style="margin:0;padding-top:1em">Welcome to The Ugly Crossiant</h2>
    <p>This is the home of all of my eggless recipes both sweet and savoury alike. I have designed these to be delicious, whether you choose to eat eggs or not, so please dive straight in.</p>
    <p><strong>A little about myself</strong></p>
    <p>My name is Nicola Easton, a 20 year old student from the UK and I am the author of The Ugly Croissant. Baking has been a passion of mine since I was very small and I have grown up testing all of the recipes I can get my hands on, so I thought it was about time that I share some of mine.</p>
    <p>I started baking eggless recipes about two years ago when I met my boyfriend who has an egg allergy. It’s been an uphill struggle trying to adapt and create recipes, with a few headaches along the way, but so far its been generally successful! This website is here to document my attempts at creating all kinds of delicious goods with a recipe page for all of my best bakes and a blog section on the homepage for comments on slightly less triumphant attempts.</p>
    <p>The biggest shame I found with eggless cooking is that there are very limited resources online or in books. I want this website to try and fill a gap for those looking for recipes, whether you’re vegetarian, intolerant or just wanting to try some delicious treats.</p>
    <p>To find all of my posts, experiments and recipe announcements, check out my Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theuglycroissant/" style="text-decoration:none;white-space:nowrap;"><i class="fab fa-instagram" style="font-size:1.5em;position:relative;top:0.125em;"></i> @theuglycroissant</a>.

    <p><strong>Why the name?</strong></p>
    <p>My dad called my croissants ugly, it caught on.</p>
