        <h2 style="margin:0;padding-top:0.5em">Welcome to The Ugly Crossiant</h2>
        <p>This website it primarily for all the tastiest recipes I have come up with so far, oh and by the way they have absolutely no eggs! All recipes are vegetarian, and some even vegan. These won't just be substitutes for any recipes you have with eggs,
            but just delicious recipes that anyone would enjoy.?</p>
        <h3>A little about myself</h3>
        <p>I'm a 20 year old student from the UK who has been baking her whole life, I've grown up in a family who all love to cook and so I couldn't help but fall in love with it. However, I didn't get into eggless baking until I met my boyfriend about
            two years ago; he has an egg allergy. I think the first recipe we made together was chocolate chip cookies, they were simple but can you really beat a cookie? I just wanted to share more food with him, it's not as fun if you have to eat a
            whole chocolate cake on your own (or is it?). So we experimented with other recipes, as time went on, and eventually The Ugly Croissant was born. The account first started out as posting pictures of experiments I have done, some ended in joy,
            others in tears. I am still learning massively, and still have no idea what I am doing half of the time, but that's all in the fun of it, but I thought I would share what I have learnt along the way. I have struggled to find lots of eggless
            recipes online, especially ones that have been tried and tested, and so hopefully this will, somewhat, help fill the gap for everyone. </p>

        <p>My dad called my croissants ugly, it caught on.</p>
